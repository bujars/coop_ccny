My favorite Editors (IDEs)

I like Vim because itâ€™s something that I am familiar with using. 
Vim is something that I have used thus far in all of my CS classes, 
so getting to use it more and more keeps allowing me to use helpful tricks. 
I also like Vim because its pre-downloaded onto my system and 
is accessible via different systems, such as OS (my laptop), 
and Linux (what I use for my classes).


Another IDE that I like is Visual Studio Code.
I like visual studio code because of the cleanness of it, 
and the easily accessible debugger. 
In my python class, I really appreciated the debugger 
whenever I missed a semicolon, or my variable was misspelled, 
it was easy to find the error and solve it.
Another appreciation that I have for visual studio code 
is the different features that can be installed to help. 
I have found various tools, such as unique indentation highlighting 
to help when nesting loops and functions. 
Lastly, I have a high appreciation for Visual Studio Code because 
it is easy to utilize with different programming languages 
from HTML, to Javascript, to C++.
